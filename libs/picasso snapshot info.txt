Picasso Info:

If we have to use a snapshot version of picasso, we copy it here.

The version might be provided as *.aar.

However, local aar-Files can only be provided if relative path (in app project) is provided. This is a problem since it requires an app using the library to specify a path in flatDirs pointing to the library module's libs folder.

So, we extract the *.jar file from the *.aar. It is called classes.jar, which we rename to match the *.aar name.
We then put the jar file in the libs folder.

The aar-File in this case, does neither contain jni files nor resources nor is something special specified in the manifest.
It solely contains proguard rules, which we copy into 'proguard-library-conusmer.pro'.
